# MET Recoil correction
The Monte Carlo has an imperfect description of the hadronic recoil. The correction
to the recoil is measured in Drell-Yan di-muon events, where the boson kinematics are
well described by the di-muon kinematics. The recoil perpendicular and parallel to the
di-muon system is measured in both data and simulations, where the mean and resolution
of these recoil components are measured.
