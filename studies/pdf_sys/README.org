# PDF and Scale Uncertainty Factors

Evaluate scale factors to account for theoretical PDF and renormalization/factorization scale uncertainties.

An array of weights for each theory source is given for the input Drell-Yan MadGraph MC. Each index in the array
is associated with a different generation configuration.

## Evaluating scale factors

Uncertainties can either be evaluated for a given index in the array of weights or evaluated by taking
the largest deviation from 1 on an event-by-event basis. To measure PDF uncertainties, use `pdf_set`
set to 0-Max Index for the individual set weights and `-1` to use the largest deviation for each event.
For the scale uncertainties, use 1000-1000+Max for the individual set weights and `-1001` to use the
largest deviation for each event.

## Current recommendation

Use `-1` and `-1001` processing on 2016 and 2018 (no 2017 LO Drell-Yan MadGraph MC available). Process
each configuration twice to get the closure plots.
