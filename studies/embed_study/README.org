* Compare Embedding and MC

* Workflow

Workflow is implemented in `make_plots.sh`

Create histograms of MC and Embedding for a given final state and year:
```
SELECTION="emu" #"mutau" "etau" "emu"
YEAR=2018
#Embedding
root.exe -q -b "make_hists.C(\"${SELECTION}\", true , ${YEAR}, true)"
#Drell-Yan
root.exe -q -b "make_hists.C(\"${SELECTION}\", false, ${YEAR}, true)"
```

Create plots comparing each:
```
root.exe -q -b "combine_plots.C(\"${SELECTION}\", ${YEAR}, true)"
```

Create plots comparing reconstructed quantities:
```
HIST_PATH=<eos histogram area>
root.exe -q -b "reco_plots.C(\"${SELECTION}\", ${YEAR}, ${HIST_PATH})"
```
